Basic flask app for hello world

## The Application

The Application is a CRUD MYSQL based Python web application built using Docker containers, orchestrated in Jenkins, and orchestrated with Docker Swarm and Docker Compose.

It's purpose is to allow a user to have two tables, namely one for Internet services, and another for a list of intelligence organisations. Both can be added, updated, read, and deleted to. There's a link in the form of a one-to-many relationship between the Internet services and the intelligence organisations tables. 

The user starts off at the homepage. They're able to access each of the pages from there, reading, updating, creating, and deleting things as they please.

At the time of writing the application and the process of development as a whole implements the following technologies:

Project Management - Jira is used to map out the development process, through the use of an Agile methodology. With sprints, tracking issues, working on the backlog, daily standup meetings, and other activities within the development cycle, I was able to get a rough approximation of where we're headed, issues that we might be facing and prioritisation in terms of tasks. Since this was a single project, I had less informal Scrum Poker sessions by looking at what I had to do, the time it might take, and what I had done.
